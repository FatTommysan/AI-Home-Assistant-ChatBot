# AI Home Assistant ChatBot

This project is currently under development. The code will be published to GitHub for everyone after I finish the product design for the project.

This project uses a Raspberry Pi to operate an AI Model and a ESP32 to control the appliances in the house.
Below is a demonstration video of my current project progress. (Update: 2 October 2025)
